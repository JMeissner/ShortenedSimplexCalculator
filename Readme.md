Simplex Calculator for short tableaus.

Each x variable needs to be seperated by space. You can ignore 1x1 -> x1 or leave the x out: 3 +4 -2

Same applies for restrictions. Restrictions need to be ended with =Number. The Calculator translates = to <=.
Valid Restriction: x1 -2x2 =10 or 1 -2 =10

The > Indicates the position of the pivot element for that step. The number next to the > is 1/pvtelmnt
